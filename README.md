## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to **analyze bank loan data** to gain valuable insights into lending activities, identify key performance indicators (KPIs), and track loan performance. This analysis aids in making **data-driven decisions** and understanding the **financial health** of the bank's lending portfolio. 📈💡

## Inspiration
This project draws inspiration from the YouTube channel **Data Tutorials**, which provided a comprehensive guide on creating effective data dashboards. Leveraging their techniques, this project delivers a robust analysis solution. 🎓📹

## Project Description
This project involves the following steps:

### 1. Data Import and Preparation
- **Import Data**: Load loan data into SQL. 📥
- **Data Cleaning**: Write SQL queries to clean and manipulate the data. 🧹
- **Connect to Power BI**: Integrate Power BI with the SQL database and import the cleaned data. 🔗
- **Further Refinement**: Transform and refine the data in Power BI. 🔄

### 2. Dashboard 1: Summary
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **Total Loan Applications**: Number of applications with Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes. 📅
  - **Total Funded Amount**: Total funds disbursed with MTD and MoM analysis. 💵
